[<u> As published today</u>](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.125431), we have theoretically studied the 6D Quantum Hall effect and how it could be probed in a three-dimensional topological pump. Thanks to Ioannis Petrides and [<u>Oded Zilberberg </u>](https://quest.phys.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich for the nice collaboration
