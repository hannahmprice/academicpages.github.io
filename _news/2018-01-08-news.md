[<u> As published today</u>](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25000), we have experimentally explored how the 4D Quantum Hall effect can be probed in a two-dimensional topological pump of ultracold atoms. Read more about it [<u>here</u>](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/physics/news/2018/taking-look-into-fourth-dimension.aspx). Thanks to [<u>Oded Zilberberg </u>](https://quest.phys.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, and Michael Lohse, Christian Schweizer and Immanuel Bloch in Munich for the great theory-experiment collaboration
