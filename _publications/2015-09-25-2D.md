abstract: 'We study the driven-dissipative steady-state of a coherently driven Bose field in a honeycomb lattice geometry. In the presence of a suitable spatial modulation of the hopping amplitudes, a valley-dependent artificial magnetic field appears and the low-energy eigenmodes have the form of relativistic Landau levels. We show how the main properties of the Landau levels can be extracted by observing the peaks in the absorption spectrum of the system and the corresponding spatial intensity distribution. Finally, quantitative predictions for realistic lattices based on photonic or microwave technologies are discussed.'
