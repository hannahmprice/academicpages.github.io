abstract: 'Modern technological advances allow for the study of systems with additional synthetic dimensions. Using such approaches, higher-dimensional physics that was previously deemed to be of purely theoretical interest has now become an active field of research. In this work, we derive from first principles using a semiclassical equation-of-motion approach the bulk response of a six-dimensional Chern insulator. We find that in such a system a quantized bulk response appears with a quantization originating from a six-dimensional topological index: the third Chern number. Alongside this unique six-dimensional response, we rigorously describe the lower even-dimensional Chern-type responses that can occur due to nonvanishing first and second Chern numbers in subspaces of the six-dimensional space. Last, we propose how to realize such a bulk response using three-dimensional topological charge pumps in cold atomic systems.'
