### Join Our Group: PhD Studentship Available!

We have a 4-year PhD studentship on Topological Photonics available in our group. This is funded by the Royal Society, and would ideally start before 31st March 2019, but all interested candidates are encouraged to [<u>get in touch</u>.](mailto:H.Price.2@bham.ac.uk)

Topological photonics is a rapidly-emerging research field in which topological ideas are exploited to  control the flow of light. By combining ideas from across condensed matter and AMO physics, topological photonics provides opportunities to design novel optical systems and to explore topological states of matter in a new context. This PhD project will explore the theory of topological photonics, focusing on the consequences of non-Hermitian effects that can arise from photon gain and loss.

This project will combine analytical and numerical calculations, and the PhD candidate should have an Undergraduate or Masters degree in Physics (preferably with first class honours or equivalent). The successful candidate is expected to have a strong general background in theoretical physics, and an interest in condensed matter physics and photonics.
