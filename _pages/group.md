### Join Our Group: PhD Studentship Available!

We have a 4-year PhD studentship on Synthetic Topological Matter available in our group. This studentship is funded by the Royal Society and should start before 31st March 2019. However, other PhD studentships with later starting-dates may become available, so do [<u>get in touch</u>.](mailto:H.Price.2@bham.ac.uk)

Synthetic topological matter is an exciting current research field in which topological ideas, originally introduced to understand electrons in solids, are exploited to design artificial systems made of atoms or light. This research area provides us with opportunities both to control artificial systems in new ways and to explore topological effects in a novel context. 

This PhD project will focus on theoretical questions in synthetic topological matter and will include both analytical and numerical calculations. The successful PhD candidate should have an Undergraduate or Masters degree in Physics (preferably with first class honours or equivalent), and is expected to have a strong general background in theoretical physics, with an interest in condensed matter physics, atomic physics and/or photonics.
