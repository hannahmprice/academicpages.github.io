abstract: 'Thanks to recent advances, the 4D quantum Hall (QH) effect is becoming experimentally accessible in ultracold atoms and photonics. In this paper, we propose a new type of 4D topological system that, unlike other 2D and 4D QH models, does not require (artificial) gauge fields and/or time-reversal symmetry breaking. Instead, we show that there are 4D QH systems that can be engineered for spinless particles by designing the lattice connectivity, and we explain how this physics can be intuitively understood in analogy with the 2D Haldane model. We illustrate our discussion with a specific 4D lattice proposal, inspired by the widely-studied 2D honeycomb and brickwall lattice geometries. As well as a minimal model for the 4D QH effect, this is also an experimental proposal for a topological system in Class AI, which supports nontrivial topological band invariants only in four spatial dimensions or higher.'
